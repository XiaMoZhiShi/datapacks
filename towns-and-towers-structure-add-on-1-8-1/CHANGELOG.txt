1.8.1 - Hotfix #1

-fixed desert temple mimic spawning a bit too high
-fixed wandering traders not spawning in wandering trader camp
-fixed pack not validating sometimes

1.8 - The Phat Update

- massive overhaul for almost all structures, which can be sorted into multiple categories:

1) Folder structure
-removed unused/irrelevant NBT files or replaced certain files with their vanilla counterparts (like for the vanilla villages)
-re-named the majority of files so they are on par with vanilla naming conventions

2) Structure modifications
-added a bell, cats, and iron golems to all town centers for all villages;
-added the remaining missing professions to all villages (exceptions being the beach, inn, and farm villages, where they were never supposed to be all present);
-added a chest/chests to each villager's profession house, corresponding to its corresponding profession (like how they are in vanilla);
-made villager profession houses separate instead of them being merged into house pieces;
-added more loot to all villages (including a few easter eggs here and there);
-massive interior and exterior overhaul for all structure pieces, made while taking into consideration villager pathfinding (meaning we made sure they could reach their workstation and bed correctly and made sure they wouldn't get stuck in the doorway because of carpets);
-changed trades for Shipmaster (Beach village) and Bishop (Med village), giving them more balanced trades, but still maintaining their uniqueness (+a few easter eggs for you to find); 
-replaced some custom loot tables with vanilla counterparts for better mod compatibility;
-replaced some villager types (for example, in the snowy slopes inn in there are now snowy villagers instead of ones found in the plains biomes);
-made the villages a bit bigger overall;
-changed the flotsam loot a bit.

3) Structure additions

OUTPOSTS
- added allays to outposts. The number of allays will differ per outpost type:
	*towers - 1 allay
	*forts - 2 allays
	*camps - 0 allays
-SPOILER: added a secret chest to each outpost containing an inspirational message and a few diamonds

VILLAGES
-remastered the sparse jungle village by adding new houses, a unique villager with unique trades (villager chief found in the town center house), and in general tidying up the whole thing to look like a proper Polynesian village
-remastered the sunflower plains farm, improving the detailing and adding more loot (but also removing the majority of sponges as we considered those a bit too OP). More will come in the next update (I won't spoil anything)
-moderately improved the Tudor village to better match its real-life design, with more wooden frames (basically made it a bit more detailed)
-moderately improved the meadow and snowy slopes villages by adding more flowers instead of spamming berry bushes, along with some nicer decor
-moderately improved the swamp village, with a new ton center, removing the barrel spam and making it seem more weathered (the boat house designs remain though)
-moderately improved the tipi camp (correctly spelled now) by adding loot to all yurts and making them look a bit nicer
-remade the beach village, with new houses, interior, general design, and loot
-added the rustic village, which can be found in more autumnal biomes (this includes modded ones)
-added the Viking village, which can be found in the snowy taiga biome and various other modded biomes with large trees and snowy landscapes
-added the grove villager outpost, which can be found in, well, grove biome. It's basically a whole village with everything one might contain shoved into a giant building (including loot)
-(INCOMPLETE) added Nilotic village, which can be found in the flooded savanna biome (WWOO exclusive --- not available as of now)

SHIPS
-remade the pillager galleon from the ground up. The structure is now worthy of that title, being literally an outpost on the sea, with lots of loot and pillagers, so be careful!
-remastered the villager fleet mothership by adding new loot and making the ship grander in general

OTHER
-remade the final room for the desert temple mimic, which now contains only 3 treasure chests instead of 8, but now has a husk spawner
-added a layer of protection to the corridor pieces so the redstone mechanism doesn't get destroyed by water
	
4) Bug fixes (keep in mind this isn't the full list because I forgot many of them)
	*fixed broken jigsaws (HOPEFULLY for the last time, but I doubt it)
	*fixed empty loot chests, most commonly found in the villager fleet
	*fixed certain pieces not generating, like the large farm for the classic village
	*fixed some villagers getting stuck in walls and suffocating
	*fixed some naming errors here and there
	*fixed chests found on villager fleet, causing servers to sometimes crash upon opening them
	*fixed jungle, flower forest, and birch villages being too sparse
	*fixed carpets blocking villagers from entering houses
	*fixed certain jigsaws turning into unwanted blocks (like terracotta for the mushroom fields village)
	*fixed minor inconsistencies in a few outposts
	*fixed issue with lower pillager spawn rates
	*fixed mimic desert temple creating a giant hole in the ground due to incorrect structure type

This update took quite a while to make, so sorry about that. We'll keep you posted about what we will take up soon. Cheers!

1.7.2 - Hotfix #2

- removed or modified some tags that made an error pop up
- fixed some broken jigsaws from the jungle village

1.7.1 - Hotfix #1

- removed the nilotic outpost tag for now

1.7 - The 1.19 update - The technical one

- updated the pack to 1.19, with all the necessary technical changes;
- major tag overhaul for all structures. This will not affect the player in any major way, but it's a measure to organize the pack a lot more;
- added mod pairing with major Worldgen mods:
	- paired the pack with Biomes O' Plenty (BoP). Now, structures from T&T will also spawn in appropriate biomes from this mod. Some vanilla villages were switched;
	- paired the pack with Oh, The Biomes You'll Go (BYG). Now, structures from T&T will also spawn in appropriate biomes from this mod. Some vanilla villages were switched;
	- paired the pack with Promenade. Now, structures from T&T will also spawn in appropriate biomes from this mod (ex: japaneese village in the cherry forests);
	- re-organized the structure distribution for Terralith. Basically, some structures were moved around to better fit their respective biome.
- added exclusion zones. Now, structures are a lot less likely to mesh with each other;

    * wreckage - normal ocean variants;

- added all villages to the village tag. Now, you can simply do /locate structure #village and find the nearest one near you, instead of locating a specific one;
- added all pillager outposts to the pillager_outpost tag, but unfortunately it won't work like with the village tag;
- fixed bug where pillagers would sometimes not spawn upon world generation (hopefully. If that's not the case, let us know);
- fixed bug where some pillager outposts would be classified as villages, preventing pillager spawning.
